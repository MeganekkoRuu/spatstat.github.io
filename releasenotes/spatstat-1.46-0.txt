# RELEASE NOTES

## spatstat 1.46-0

### 6 July 2016

   We thank Corey Anderson and Sebastian Meyer for contributions..

### OVERVIEW

 * spatstat now depends on R 3.3.0 or later.

 * Improvements to inhomogeneous multitype K and L functions.

 * Variance approximation for pair correlation function.

 * Leverage and influence for multitype point process models.

 * Functions for extracting components of vector-valued objects.

 * Important bug fix in Smooth.ppp

 * Minor improvements and bug fixes.

 * Version nickname: 'Multidimensional Toothbrush'

### NEW FUNCTIONS

 * split.msr
   Decompose a measure into parts.

 * unstack.msr
   Decompose a vector-valued measure into its component measures.

 * unstack.ppp, unstack.psp, unstack.lpp
   Given a spatial pattern with several columns of marks,
   separate the columns and return a list of spatial patterns, 
   each having only one column of marks.

 * kernel.squint
   Integral of squared kernel, for the kernels used in density estimation.

### SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

 * Kcross.inhom, Kdot.inhom, Kmulti.inhom, Ldot.inhom, Lcross.inhom
   These functions now allow intensity values to be given by
   a fitted point process model.
   New arguments 'update', 'leaveoneout', 'lambdaX'.

 * diagnose.ppm
   Infinite values of 'rbord' are now ignored and treated as zero.
   This ensures that diagnose.ppm has a sensible default
   when the fitted model has infinite reach.

 * pcf.ppp
   Now calculates an analytic approximation to the variance of
   the estimate of the pair correlation function (when var.approx=TRUE).
   Now returns the smoothing bandwidth used, as an attribute of the result.
    
 * plot.ppp
   When 'clipwin' is given, any parts of the boundary of the window of x
   that lie inside 'clipwin' will also be plotted.

 * plot.msr
   Now handles multitype measures.
   New argument 'multiplot'.

 * plot.anylist
   If a list entry x[[i]] belongs to class 'anylist', it will be expanded
   so that each entry x[[i]][[j]] will be plotted as a separate panel.

 * influence.ppm, leverage.ppm
   These can now be applied to multitype point process models
   and the results can be plotted.

 * plot.influence.ppm, plot.leverage.ppm
   New argument 'multiplot'.

 * plot.anylist, plot.solist, plot.listof
   New arguments panel.begin.args, panel.end.args

 * influence.ppm, leverage.ppm, dfbetas.ppm
   For Gibbs models, memory usage has been dramatically reduced, 
   so the code can handle larger datasets and finer quadrature schemes.

### BUG FIXES

 1. Smooth.ppp
    Results were incorrect when at='points' and leaveoneout=FALSE.
    [Bug introduced in spatstat 1.20-5, October 2010.]
    Fixed.

 2. funxy
    Did not correctly handle one-line functions:
    the resulting objects evaluated the wrong function in some cases.
    [Spotted by Sebastian Meyer. Bug introduced in spatstat 1.45-0]
    Fixed.

 3. mppm
    Did not recognise the variable 'marks' in a formula.
    Fixed.

 4. Smooth.ppp, bw.smoothppp
    Crashed if X had two columns of marks and one column was constant.
    [Bug introduced in spatstat 1.38-0, October 2014]
    Fixed.

 5. Smooth.ppp
    Results for 'at="points"' were garbled, for some values of 'sigma',
    if X had more than one column of marks.
    [Bug introduced in spatstat 1.38-0, October 2014]
    Fixed.

 6. plot.layered
    Crashed if one layer was a point pattern with several columns of marks.
    Fixed. 

 7. plot.ppm
    Sometimes gave a spurious warning about a singular matrix.
    Fixed.

 8. setminus.owin
    Gave wrong or strange answer if the correct answer was empty.
    Fixed.

 9. parameters.dppm
    Crashed, due to a typo.
    Fixed.

 10. progressreport
     Crashed if n = 1. 
     Fixed.
