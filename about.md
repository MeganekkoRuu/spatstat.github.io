## About `spatstat`

Two decades of work by Adrian Baddeley and Rolf Turner, with support
from the scientific community, have gone into the creation and
development of spatstat. The package includes substantial contributions
of code from Kasper Klitgaard Berthelsen, Abdollah Jalilian,
Marie-Colette van Lieshout, Ege Rubak, Dominic Schuhmacher and Rasmus
Waagepetersen. In particular Ege Rubak has recently been playing
a significant role and has now joined the spatstat developer team. 
The user community has generously contributed data
sets, bug reports and fixes, and code for new purposes.
