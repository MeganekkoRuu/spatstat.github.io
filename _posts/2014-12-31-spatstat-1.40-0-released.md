* Important bug fixes.
* Mathematical operators now apply to images.

* Standard errors for relative risk (parametric and non-parametric).
* Kernel smoothing and rose diagrams for angular data.
* Perceptually uniform colour maps. 
* Hierarchical interactions for multitype patterns.
* Hard core parameters in all interactions no longer need to be specified and will be estimated from data.

* New datasets.
* New vignette, summarising all datasets installed with spatstat.
* Tests and diagnostics now include a Monte Carlo option.
* Faster checking of large datasets.
