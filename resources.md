## Software documentation

These are the two main places to find help for a specific spatstat
function. In particular the first one is good for browsing around for
functions if you are looking to do a specific task.

-   [Quick Reference Guide](resources/spatstatQuickref.pdf) (pdf) listing all functions and datasets
-   Complete [manual](resources/spatstatManual.pdf) for the package, containing all the help files (pdf, 1367 pages, 8.2Mb)

## References covering the use of the package

These articles give more explanation about how to use
spatstat. Article [1] covers basic use of the package. Article [2]
explains how to fit models to point pattern data. The notes
[3] are from a two-day training workshop on the spatstat package given in 2010
(which is now out-of-date). The forthcoming book [5] is a complete 
course on spatial point patterns and the use of spatstat.
